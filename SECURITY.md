# Security policy

Vireo reads untrusted content — every message it opens was written by someone
else — so security reports are welcome and taken seriously.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please report privately, not as a public issue.** Either channel works:

- **GitHub private vulnerability reporting** — <https://github.com/hyprlab/vireo/security/advisories/new>
  (Security → Report a vulnerability). This is the preferred route: it keeps the
  report, the discussion and the eventual advisory in one place.
- **Email** — hyprlab@proton.me

You should get a first reply within **5 days**. If you don't, assume the mail
went astray and open a public issue saying only that you're trying to reach a
maintainer privately — no details.

Useful things to include, none of them required: affected version, the file and
line if you have it, what an attacker gains, and anything that reproduces it
(a `.eml` file is ideal for reader bugs).

## Disclosure

Report privately, and there is no deadline being run against you. The intent is
to ship a fix, publish a GitHub Security Advisory, and credit you by whatever
name and link you'd like — or not at all, if you'd rather. If you want to write
the finding up, say so and a date can be agreed; **90 days** is a reasonable
default if nothing else is proposed.

Nothing here is meant to restrict what you may say about your own research.

## Supported versions

Fixes go into the next release from `main`. Older versions are not patched
separately — Vireo ships as a Flatpak, an RPM and an Arch package, and all three
track releases.

## Scope

In scope, roughly in order of interest:

- Anything letting message content escape the reader's sandbox, run script, or
  read other messages.
- Anything defeating remote-content blocking, or otherwise causing a network
  request the user didn't ask for.
- Credential handling — the keyring, OAuth, what reaches disk.
- TLS: verification, downgrade, `STARTTLS` handling.
- Sandbox escapes and over-broad Flatpak permissions.
- File permissions on anything Vireo writes.

Out of scope: vulnerabilities in the user's own mail server, findings that need
an attacker who already has local code execution as the user, and reports
consisting only of scanner output.

## Notes on the design

Two things are deliberate and are not bugs:

- **Message bodies render with JavaScript disabled**, in a `sandbox`ed iframe
  without `allow-scripts`, under `default-src 'none'`. The wrapper document
  around them does run one script — it sizes the frames — and carries a
  nonce-based CSP so nothing else in that document can run.
- **Remote content is blocked by default** and the blocking follows the user's
  setting, not a guess about whether a message contains remote references. A
  detector miss should cost you the "blocked" banner, never the blocking.

If you find a case where either isn't true, that's exactly the kind of report
this file is for.
