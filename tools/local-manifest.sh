# Two callers need this:
#
#   - the aarch64 CI build, which runs on the release tag. The manifest's pin is
#     written in a commit *after* the tag (a commit can't contain its own hash),
#     so the manifest as it exists at vX.Y.Z still points at the previous
#     release — building it verbatim would ship the wrong version.
#   - local test builds, to see uncommitted work without pushing anything.
#
# Everything else — runtime, finish-args, build commands, vendored crates — is
# left exactly as the release manifest has it, so the two builds stay honest
# about being the same recipe.
