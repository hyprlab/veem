//! Running in the background, the way GNOME expects (issue #3).
//!
//! GNOME has no system tray — the sanctioned equivalent is the **Background
//! Apps** section of Quick Settings, which xdg-desktop-portal populates from
//! sandboxed apps that are running without a window. So keeping the process
//! alive after the last window closes is what puts Vireo there; nothing needs to
//! draw an icon.
//!
//! Two portal calls make it a good citizen rather than a mystery process:
//!
//! * `RequestBackground` asks the user's permission to keep running, and can
//!   register an autostart entry so Vireo is already watching for mail at login.
//! * `SetStatus` sets the line shown beside the app in that menu, so it says
//!   what it is doing rather than merely existing.
//!
//! Both are best-effort. On a desktop with no portal — or with the permission
//! refused — Vireo still runs; it just isn't listed, which is the desktop's
//! decision to make, not ours.
