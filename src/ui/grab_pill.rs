//! The grab pill: a thin rounded bar floated near a pane boundary, the iOS

/// of the divider. `clamp` bounds each candidate position; hand the Paned's
/// own limits back unchanged with `|_, p| p`.
///
/// The caller aligns the pill against its boundary (`set_valign` +
/// margin) and adds it to an Overlay over the pane it rides.
///
/// The pointer is tracked in ROOT coordinates: the pill rides a pane the drag
/// itself resizes, so pill-local offsets would feed back into the resize and
/// jitter (the console grip's trick).
